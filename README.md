# The Causes of Wildfires in the United States
## Effie Harker, Jeremy Hamley, Bhavin Sanghavi, and Shahil Jani
## Objective
Analyze data from wildfires from 2010-2020 to find trends in wildfire occurance. Our goal was to pinpoint the causes of wildfires in the United States. Looking at drought data, wind patterns, and ocean temperatures, we were able to create visualizations that give us a clearer picture of the trends between enviornmental factors and wildfire occurance. 
## Visualizations

According to NOAA : "The moderate drought category, D1, corresponds to an area where damage to crops and pastures can be expected and where fire risk is high, while stream, reservoir, or well levels are low. The severe drought category, D2, corresponds to an area where crop or pasture losses are likely, fire risk is very high, water shortages are common, and water restrictions are typically voluntary or mandated. The extreme drought category, D3, corresponds to an area where major crop and pasture losses are common, fire risk is extreme, and widespread water shortages can be expected requiring restrictions. The highest category, exceptional drought, or D4, corresponds to an area experiencing exceptional and widespread crop and pasture losses, fire risk, and water shortages that result in water emergencies."
