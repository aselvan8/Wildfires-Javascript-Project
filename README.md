# Wildfires-Project
## Objective
Analyze data from wildfires from 2010-2020 to find trends in wildfire occurance. Our goal was to pinpoint the causes of wildfires in the United States. Looking at drought data, wind patterns, and ocean temperatures, we were able to create visualizations that give us a clearer picture of the trends between enviornmental factors and wildfire occurance.
