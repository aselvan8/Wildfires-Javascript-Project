# Wildfires-Project
## Objective
Analyze data from wildfires from 2010-2020 to find trends in wildfire occurance. Our goal was to pinpoint the causes of wildfires in the United States. Looking at drought data, wind patterns, and ocean temperatures, we were able to create visualizations that give us a clearer picture of the trends between enviornmental factors and wildfire occurance. 
## Visualizations
The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) is the main indicator for monitoring climate patterns called the El Nino-Southern OScillation (ENSO). An ONI of +0.5C indicates El Nino conditions, while -0.5C La Nina conditions. El Nino conditions tend to create more opportunities for wildfire conditions in the United States.

The following visualization shows the ONI for the last 10 years.
